              <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hello, I am a rising senior at Eastlake High School. My interest in the workings of the human mind has led me to develop a deep passion for neuroscience. I am fascinated by the complexity of the brain and the vast potential it holds for understanding human behavior and improving health outcomes. I have been volunteering at a local hospital, where I have had the privilege of interacting with elderly patients with various mental and physical disabilities. I offer them books and magazines, but more importantly, I provide them with meaningful conversations. These interactions have not only helped me understand the impact of different neurodegenerative diseases but have also highlighted the importance of empathy and communication in completely understanding and improving the condition of these disorders. Additionally, I am an active member of the HOSA chapter at my school. My involvement in HOSA has allowed me to participate in medical innovation projects, where I continuously explore ways to improve the healthcare field. This experience has furthered my interest in neuroscience and my desire to contribute to the medical field. I am excited to work as a Co-Founder in the Seattle Neuro-Education Initiative and I can't wait to collaborate with other high schoolers with similar interests.</p>">

              <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hi, I am a rising senior at Henry M. Jackson High School, excited to be a co-founder of the neuro-education initiative. My unbound passion for neuroscience stemmed from a variety of profound experiences, beginning at Camp Prov, where I have been a summer volunteer, working with neurodivergent youth. This experience is what inspired me to delve deeper into learning more about the neurodivergent community. Relating it to my interest in research, I have been investigating biomarker identification research for youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder. For my work, I am honored to have been awarded recognition by the American Psychological Association. Now, I also volunteer at a stroke unit and have continued serving our community in a myriad of ways, promoting mindfulness in youth to advocate for actionable mental health awareness. In the glimpses of in-between time, you can find me either scouring the newest scientific journals and magazines to learn about novel innovations or perhaps even belting out nostalgic Disney songs with my sister, but most often, you can find me making new connections, eager to learn, mentor and give as I hope to do with the neuro-education initiative!</p>">

              <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hi, I am a rising senior at Eastlake High School. I am passionate about pursuing a career that involves biosciences and engineering, specifically neuroprosthetics. I am inspired by the works of Professor Hugh Herr and would love to follow in his footsteps. I have spent 13 years learning how to assemble and program intelligent robots. At school, courses such as AP Biology and Anatomy &amp; Physiology have been fascinating windows into how the brain functions. In addition, I enjoy participating in DECA and other extracurricular activities. In my free time, I am usually in the outdoors or spending time with friends and family. I am excited to work alongside other motivated high schoolers to ensure education is accessible for all, regardless of socioeconomic status.</p>">

At school, I am a state champion in three events as part of HOSA and TSA (Technology Student Association), and won two special awards at the Central Sound and Washington State Science and Engineering Fairs for my research project in toxicology and endocrine disruption. I am also a volunteer at my local hospital and in my free time, play competitive badminton for my high school. I started SNEI because neuroscience is an ever-expanding field, with new discoveries being made daily that have strong impacts on our future scientists. Our generation has become hugely advocative of mental health disorders, and one step to lessening the stigma of these and other neurological conditions is to normalize and study them. I am excited to help others learn about this incredible field! </p>">

                <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hello, I am a rising senior at Eastlake High School. I competed in DECA with a 20 page report on coronary heart disease research and its role in the ease of monitoring heart health. Including the use of an electrolyte regulated monitor (ERM) and an amplified heart disease detector(AHDD), two product prototypes I created. In my international internship in Kotputli last summer, I observed 3 surgeons for a total of 240 hours, watching active surgery in the Operating Room. I also gained knowledge about surgery as a medical specialty by observing 1200+ patient contacts through making rounds in the ICU and viewing 12+ invasive surgeries. In July 2023, through the UW YSP neuroscience program I observed 5 scientists detail neuroscience as a medical specialty including experts in the field such as Sara Georing and her research on Neuroethics and Neurotechnology. By learning about brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neural stimulation’s potential to restore abilities in individuals with paralysis and addressing conditions like Parkinson's disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Attending lectures that detailed the development of encoding algorithms and stimulation patterns, tailored to individual needs and contexts, is crucial for optimizing the effectiveness of BCIs and neural stimulation has peaked my interest in the neurosurgical field. When I'm not competing in a national competition, I'm working on art for my business TheCloudArtsUSA, or painting wall murals for a partnered 501c(3) non-profit, Expressions. I hope to learn and grow through the neuro-education initiative.</p>">

              <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hello, I am a rising senior at Eastlake High School in Sammamish, Washington. I aspire to pursue a career in medicine and hope to be a psychiatrist. My deep interest in psychology led me to further develop a passion for studying the human brain. What fascinates me most is how the brain and environmental factors determine a human’s behavior, and how that can be studied. I am a part of the COPE Junior Health Scholars program as well as the Overlake Teen Volunteer program. Through these two programs, I have had lots of experience discharging, taking vitals, and periodically checking in on patients. These experiences not only taught me the importance of effective communication in the healthcare environment, but also showed me the impact of various conditions on people. This not only provided me with valuable experience in clinical settings, but also heightened my interest in psychology and neuroscience. In my free time, I work as an intern at the Sammamish Montessori School, and a teacher at Samskrita Bharati. I completed the SAFL Sanskrit program and have been volunteering as an assistant teacher at Samskrita Bharati Seattle Chapter for 6 years. I love hiking, painting and baking. I am interested in becoming a part of SNEI due to the research opportunities it provides me, and excited to meet several other like-minded people.</p>">

                <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hi, I am a sophomore at Liberty High School, Renton. I have been watching various minor surgical procedures like wound management, chest tube insertion, central line insertion, which piqued my interest in the surgical field. As a result, I set a goal to become a surgeon. During weekdays, I am generally busy catching up on my school homework. On weekends, I primarily study for the upcoming AP exam. On Sunday evenings, I play basketball with my friends. When I want to relax, I play the saxophone, one of my favorite activities. I love reading history and have read quite a few historical fiction novels. I am planning to start my ACT preparation in the summer. However, during the summer, I want to spend two weeks visiting different European countries to better understand their culture and history. Recently, I developed an interest in neuroscience and found it exciting to know about the human brain. In the summer, I am willing to work with the co-founders of the Seattle Neuro-Education Initiative project to spread the essence of neuroscience globally. I understand it is a very long road when someone wants to be a surgeon. It involves 15 years of dedication after high school, and I will be 32 by then. But I am passionate and determined to achieve my goal. So, during my remaining high school years, I hope to conserve energy, improve my life skills, and be ready physically and mentally for the upcoming challenges in college and beyond.</p>">

              <p style='text-align: justify;'>I'm Vibhi, a rising freshman at North Creek High School. I'm interested in science, specifically biology. Due to this, I have participated in the Science Olympiad club and have been a part of it for the past 2 years. My school introduced Science Olympiad for the first time when I was in 7th grade, and I took that chance to try something new. Last year, I won 3rd place in regionals and 4th place at the state level of the competition. I have also represented my school at the Science Bowl competition. Similar to the Science Olympiad club , the Science Bowl competition was introduced for the first time at my school this year. The reason for joining these competitions was due to my fascination for life science.I find life science intriguing because learning about it helps me to understand myself and my surroundings better. In the future, I hope to conduct research on medical topics and give back to my community. Other than science, I've been playing flute in my school band for the past 3 years, and I look forward to joining the high school band. I also occasionally like to play badminton, crochet, knit, and read (mostly mystery books). I also enjoy painting. Last year, I sold some of my paintings and donated the money that I earned. This act not only helped me to be creative but also helped people in need. I felt a sense of accomplishment after doing this.this experience also sparked my curiosity about the brain and its role in emotions.The brain is truly fascinating, which is why I'm excited to be a part of this initiative.</p>">

Ever since I was a kid, I've been captivated by the human body, especially the mind-boggling complexity of the brain. My fascination with neurology really kicked into high gear when I saw my great grandparents struggling with brain-related issues like brain strokes and Alzheimer’s during their last days. That firsthand experience led me to dive deep into understanding the brain and its workings. I've been volunteering at a memory care center, where I've gained invaluable insights into the challenges faced by those battling advanced dementia and Alzheimer’s. It's been eye-opening and incredibly rewarding. Beyond neurology, I'm passionate about mental health advocacy and tackling hunger issues in my community. I believe in making a difference where it matters most. When I'm not busy with all that, you can find me lost in a good book, exploring new cuisines, or catching up on the latest movies.

I love volunteering and volunteer all the time to help support locals! I’ve donated over 200 meals to multiple local food banks, and I’ve also hosted multiple food drives to help out people in need. I currently enjoy playing the piano and have performed multiple times at public places including local churches. I love gardening, and love to teach it, to encourage the newer generations of people to stay healthy and active. When not researching medical innovations, I like playing sports such as basketball and badminton, and enjoy painting and hiking tall mountains.</p>">
