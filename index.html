              <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hello, I am a rising senior at Eastlake High School. My interest in the workings of the human mind has led me to develop a deep passion for neuroscience. I am fascinated by the complexity of the brain and the vast potential it holds for understanding human behavior and improving health outcomes. I have been volunteering at a local hospital, where I have had the privilege of interacting with elderly patients with various mental and physical disabilities. I offer them books and magazines, but more importantly, I provide them with meaningful conversations. These interactions have not only helped me understand the impact of different neurodegenerative diseases but have also highlighted the importance of empathy and communication in completely understanding and improving the condition of these disorders. Additionally, I am an active member of the HOSA chapter at my school. My involvement in HOSA has allowed me to participate in medical innovation projects, where I continuously explore ways to improve the healthcare field. This experience has furthered my interest in neuroscience and my desire to contribute to the medical field. I am excited to work as a Co-Founder in the Seattle Neuro-Education Initiative and I can't wait to collaborate with other high schoolers with similar interests.</p>">

              <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hi, I am a rising senior at Henry M. Jackson High School, excited to be a co-founder of the neuro-education initiative. My unbound passion for neuroscience stemmed from a variety of profound experiences, beginning at Camp Prov, where I have been a summer volunteer, working with neurodivergent youth. This experience is what inspired me to delve deeper into learning more about the neurodivergent community. Relating it to my interest in research, I have been investigating biomarker identification research for youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder. For my work, I am honored to have been awarded recognition by the American Psychological Association. Now, I also volunteer at a stroke unit and have continued serving our community in a myriad of ways, promoting mindfulness in youth to advocate for actionable mental health awareness. In the glimpses of in-between time, you can find me either scouring the newest scientific journals and magazines to learn about novel innovations or perhaps even belting out nostalgic Disney songs with my sister, but most often, you can find me making new connections, eager to learn, mentor and give as I hope to do with the neuro-education initiative!</p>">

                <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hello, I am a rising senior at Eastlake High School. I competed in DECA with a 20 page report on coronary heart disease research and its role in the ease of monitoring heart health. Including the use of an electrolyte regulated monitor (ERM) and an amplified heart disease detector(AHDD), two product prototypes I created. In my international internship in Kotputli last summer, I observed 3 surgeons for a total of 240 hours, watching active surgery in the Operating Room. I also gained knowledge about surgery as a medical specialty by observing 1200+ patient contacts through making rounds in the ICU and viewing 12+ invasive surgeries. In July 2023, through the UW YSP neuroscience program I observed 5 scientists detail neuroscience as a medical specialty including experts in the field such as Sara Georing and her research on Neuroethics and Neurotechnology. By learning about brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neural stimulation’s potential to restore abilities in individuals with paralysis and addressing conditions like Parkinson's disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Attending lectures that detailed the development of encoding algorithms and stimulation patterns, tailored to individual needs and contexts, is crucial for optimizing the effectiveness of BCIs and neural stimulation has peaked my interest in the neurosurgical field. When I'm not competing in a national competition, I'm working on art for my business TheCloudArtsUSA, or painting wall murals for a partnered 501c(3) non-profit, Expressions. I hope to learn and grow through the neuro-education initiative.</p>">

                <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hi, I am a sophomore at Liberty High School, Renton. I have been watching various minor surgical procedures like wound management, chest tube insertion, central line insertion, which piqued my interest in the surgical field. As a result, I set a goal to become a surgeon. During weekdays, I am generally busy catching up on my school homework. On weekends, I primarily study for the upcoming AP exam. On Sunday evenings, I play basketball with my friends. When I want to relax, I play the saxophone, one of my favorite activities. I love reading history and have read quite a few historical fiction novels. I am planning to start my ACT preparation in the summer. However, during the summer, I want to spend two weeks visiting different European countries to better understand their culture and history. Recently, I developed an interest in neuroscience and found it exciting to know about the human brain. In the summer, I am willing to work with the co-founders of the Seattle Neuro-Education Initiative project to spread the essence of neuroscience globally. I understand it is a very long road when someone wants to be a surgeon. It involves 15 years of dedication after high school, and I will be 32 by then. But I am passionate and determined to achieve my goal. So, during my remaining high school years, I hope to conserve energy, improve my life skills, and be ready physically and mentally for the upcoming challenges in college and beyond.</p>">

                <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hi, I am a rising Junior at Juanita High School (Cambridge Program), Kirkland, WA. I am really excited about this initiative. While there is the internet, we still do not have it all and There is so much inequality in terms of access to quality knowledge. I, along with my friends here, hope to break the barrier of entry for all students across the globe. I hope this effort will level the playing field and quality content available to all who are interested. I am passionate about invention, research and biomedical engineering. I am the founder of the Biotechnology club at my school and the Vice President of the “Coding for Medicine” club too. I love biology and especially applying research/technology to improve it. I am interested in building devices and my friends and I recently built a Moon Rover using Arduino for WA TSA and were placed as finalists. I love building medical instruments or devices and recently built an Arduino based infant liver disease detection device (aka ChromoLiv).  I also love AI/ ML and have built mini projects with it. Apart from science, I love swimming and I’m a part of the Junior Varsity Swim team at my school.  I love art and have been drawing / painting for the past 10 years. I paint with anything that is available, such as shoes,  canvases , rocks, digital media, T-Shirts, and regular paper too :) . I've won a couple of local awards for art. In my spare time, I teach art to kids. In addition, I love to do community service such as meals for shelters, blankets for puppies or tree planting. Last year, I won the PVSA award for social service. Again, looking forward to partnering with you all and making this initiative a great success. I wish to thank my parents, teachers, friends and coaches who have helped me to be who I am today.</p>">

                <p style='text-align: justify;'>Hi, I am a rising freshman at Tesla STEM High School. I like to debate, play piano, hike, and play basketball with my friends. Debating has made me understand different perspectives and it has helped me be more open to new ideas. I aspire to become a medical doctor, and my keen interest in both biology and psychology makes neuroscience - a captivating blend of these fields - exceptionally intriguing. As the president of the National Junior Honor Society at my middle school, I have had many opportunities to lead efforts to make our school and our community safer and better for everyone. I organized events to improve the school campus, such as planting native plants and trees and removing invasive species. Through these activities, we not only cleaned up our school environment but also learned about the importance of our ecosystem and how everything is interconnected. Being part of NJHS has taught me the value of teamwork, and I now understand that successful completion of any task relies on the proper functioning of the entire team. This concept applies to the brain too. All the different parts of the brain must function properly and with coordination for the brain to run smoothly. I have always been interested in the brain and how it makes decisions and controls our body. It is intriguing to think about why the brain makes the decisions it does, and what the brain is thinking about in its subconscious. Each part of the brain has its own functions, and I am very excited to learn and share my knowledge about the brain through the Neuro-Education Initiative. Truly understanding the human brain is something scientists have puzzled over for centuries, searching for the essence of life, and if students can learn this essential information, we are one step closer to understanding ourselves and the world around us.

In my free time, I have been a chess tutor to elementary and middle school grade students and have been earning pocket money via this opportunity which go towards St Jude Children's Research Hospital. In addition, I enjoy being a member of HOSA, DECA and TSA clubs at school and participating in several events via these clubs to learn and grow in the field of biology. I hope to learn, diving deep, grow and make a positive impact through this neuro-education initiative.</p>">
